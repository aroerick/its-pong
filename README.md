##Tech

Pong is built almost completely in JavaScript (lite html and css).

It's all about being object oriented.

##Learning

Learned so much stuff. OOP is really interesting and makes workflow real smooth.

##Strectch Goals

Added a victory screen based on which player wins.

When the ball hits your paddle or you score, a random sound clip plays.

If your rally hits more than 10, the ball shrinks slightly and changes color.
